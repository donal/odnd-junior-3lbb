# OD&D for younger players

## Combat

### Surprise

First determine surprise.

Surprised on a roll of 1 or 2.

If one side gains surprise, they are within 1-3" and can take a full round of actions — the surprised side cannot act.

### Initiative

Initiative is determined by the DM, or if necessary, by each side (or each group of combatants) rolling a 1d6. The side with the higher roll gains initiative.

Initiative may be adjusted by Dexterity.

Examples where an initiative roll isn't needed:

* Missile fire and spells always go before enemy closes distance for melee
* Defenders with long weapons — spears and halberds — will go before an attacking enemy on the first round of melee

Examples where an initiative roll is needed:

* Who strikes first in melee
* Missile fire versus spell casting

### Turn order

1. Declare actions
2. Roll initiative per side
3. Winning side acts first
4. Losing side acts second
5. Morale check

### Actions

These take a full turn:

1. Move
2. Attack while in melee
3. Fire a missile
4. Move (up to 1/3 normal movement) and make a melee attack
5. Cast a spell

#### Open Locks

Failure to open a lock indicates that the lock must be forced open - a very time consuming process.

#### Remove traps

Thieves automatically find traps.

Failure to remove a trap activates it with regard the thief and any others within its range.

#### Climb sheer walls

Climb almost sheer surfaces, up or down, without equipment.

#### Steal item by stealth

Removing an item from its owner or their immediate vicinity has the same chance as moving with stealth.

#### Move silently

The likelihood of moving with absolute silence.

#### Hide in shadows

The chance to remain undetected when hiding or moving through shadows. Requires shadows and a lack of observation prior to hiding.

#### Hear noise

Listen for noises behind a closed door.

#### Surprise

If undetected by _either_ moving silently or hiding in shadows, the Thief as the opportunity to gain surprise on a 1-3 on 1d6.

If undetected by _both_ moving silently and hiding in shadows, the Thief as the opportunity to gain surprise on a 1-4 on 1d6.
