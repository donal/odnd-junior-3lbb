## Combat

### Surprise

First determine surprise.

Surprised on a roll of 1 or 2.

If one side gains surprise, they are within 1-3" and can take a full round of actions — the surprised side cannot act.

### Initiative

Initiative is determined by each side (or each group of combatants) rolling a 1d6. The side with the higher roll gains initiative.

### Turn order

1. Declare actions
2. Roll initiative per side
3. Winning side acts first
4. Losing side acts second
5. Morale check

### Actions

These take a full turn:

1. Move
2. Attack while in melee
3. Fire a missile
4. Cast a spell
