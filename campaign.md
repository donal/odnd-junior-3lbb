Location is the wild eastern coast of the continent. There's a natural deep harbour and a city that's grown up around there. Trading ships coming from North and South stop there to trade, resupply etc. as it's the only safe location for a long way in both directions.

There are two rivers coming into the city, with some trade from settlements inland. The settlements inland are not that well protected from the wilds. Further off there is some bigger kingdom, and some trade ends up on one of the rivers to the city (after crossing mountains etc.), but it's a long journey.

There's a large, wild island quite a bit off the coast. There's a port on the western side that's maintained by this city state — nominally to protect against the pirates who dwell on the far eastern coast of this island — but it is a bit of a den of iniquity.

To the north of the harbour city is a large wild area of deep forests that go to the cliffs — a large area of land that juts out to the east and around which ships have to sail.

To the south, the lands are less forested, more open, but still wild.

B3 and X2 would be in the south (but they're quite magical, so not really in the same lands).

B4 is in the middle of the island.

B5 and B10 are up river, inland. B10 is closer to the large forests.

RPGA1 and 2 are up river, inland.

X1 is someway off to the southeast.
