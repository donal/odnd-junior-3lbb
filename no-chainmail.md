So how do you play, especially combat, if you don't have Chainmail?

* all weapons do 1d6 damage
    * therefore there's no way to distinguish weapons
* initiative dice, modified by Dex
* multiple attacks vs non-fantastical
    * well actually see Chainmail for fantastical
* still think you have multiple things going on in a round
    * ie. from Chainmail
    * but use initiative for who strikes first, ie. ignore weapon class (doesn't matter anyway since everything does d6)
    * should stil handle charge so long weapons go first
    * don't use parry/multiple attacks
    * initiative roll also determines spell vs spell and missile vs missile
* surprise as written

House rules:

* Start at 3rd level
* smoothed HD for PCs

# Combat

* can't have multiple attacks
* no point using Weapon Class to determine who strikes first (except for charges)

## Turn order

1. write orders
2. both sides take first half of movement
3. pass-through and split-move missile fire taken
    * pass-through missile fire can only be taken by stationary combatants
    * use initiative result to determine missile fire order, if required
5. remaining movement taken
6. spell casting
    * use initiative result to determine spell casting order, if required
7. missile fire
    * use initiative result to determine missile fire order, if required
8. melee
    * use initiative result to determine melee attack order
    * for charges, longer weapons (higher weapon class) attack first
9. stationary combatants may take a second missile attack

### Charge

Charge movement is double move indoors.

Attackers get:

* +2 to-hit
* the attackers strike first unless defender has a weapon which is two classes higher
* attackers take double damage against defenders who have set spears etc.

### Melee

* a fantastic creature against non-fantastic combatants gets multiple attacks per round equal to their HD
* any creature with levels is considered fantastic

From Chainmail:

Fantastic creatures:

* Dragon
* Elemental
* Ghoul
* Giant
* Lycanthrope
* Ogre
* Roc
* Treant
* Troll
* Wight
* Wraith

Non-fantastic creatures (anything with a base 1 HD):

* Bear/Wolf
* Dwarves
* Elves
* Fairies
* Goblins
* Gnomes
* Halflings
* Orcs
* Pixies
* Sprites

# Notes

* there's fantastic and non-fantastic combat
* initiative dice
    * highest score gains "first attack that round"
    * adjustment for dexterity
* combat phases
    * movement
    * spells
    * missile
    * melee

## Combat

More thoughts:

* based on chainmail, but alternate combat only
* roll initiative dice
* bonus for dex — applies to all phases (even movement? maybe, that'd be interesting but probably better off not using it for this)
    * _maybe_ spells 1-2 = 0, 3-4 = -1 initiative, 5-6 = -2 initiative
* still have phasees: move/half-move, spells, missile (I'd actually combine spells+missile so initiative has more impact = yes), melee from CM
* first round of melee, long weapons get bonus to init, then reverse
    * use short(-1), medium(0), long(+1), very long(+2)
    * WC 1 = short, WC 3-7 = medium, 8-10 = long, 11+ = very long
    * something like -1 to initiative when changing weapons?
    * could do some whack thing like WC - WC for penalty to initiative ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ not worth it — may as well just use rules
* anyone at 3" is -1 to initiative
* monsters at 15"+ are +1 to initiative
* might just be too many adjustments for initiative ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* fighters get multiple attacks vs 1HD (and per HD, so against 0.5 HD, they'd get 2)
    * these should be either auto kills or every hit is a kill (dont roll damage) - maybe the latter
    * 2H weapons give them more attacks (not sure by how much) — let's say double (this handles battle axe 2H too) or 1.5 round up
* weapons still do d6 damage
* use weapon type vs AC
    * use against natural armour that maps to an AC
    * don't use against creatures for whose AC is based on other things (speed, magic)
    * I'm not 100% sure this needs to be used as we distinguished weapons in other ways
        * er what ways? initiative isn't much of a difference now, and extra attacks vs non-fantastic is?
* definitely have charging
    * use WC to determine who strikes first, not initiative
* TODO find rules for converting d8 monsters to d6
* TODO morale
* can target whomever you want in missile and melee (and spells)
    * should declare before initiative roll
    * random targets is really just for non-fantastic combat and since there are just kills it doesn't matter anyway
* definitely not using parrying rules
* creatures with non-armour good AC should get bonus to initiative? well if they're fast say
    * this is where people use "compare Dex", so this is similar
* for combat against mixed fantastic and non-fantastic troops, the Fighter can either make multiple attacks against non-fantastic, or attack the fantastic monster(s)

Notes about spells in CM: https://odd74.proboards.com/thread/253/spells-chainmail-edition = during artillery fire phase (before missile).

Actually it'd be nice to have spells before missiles and do away with initiative dice (except for move) and hence do away with initiative bonus. But that means daggers always go before 2H swords in 2nd round onward melee. But other than being killing machines in non-fantastic combat, there's no difference between a 2H sword and a dagger (well actually the dagger is better cos it'll always hit first). Maybe just stick with an initiative roll...yeah well, bottom line is, if you're avoiding CM rules, you need the version with initiative dice.

Question: if missile fire can make up to a half-move, does that mean those closing for melee (ie. moving to attack) can throw weapons? Should say yes to this (but not fire bows).

Other thoughts:

* 2D6 take highest for damage from 2H weapons
* 2D6 take lowest for damage from light weapons
* 1D6 otherwise
* dual wield +1 to attack, deal damage from best weapon
* shields shall be splintered
* 2H auto initiative on first round
* https://www.necropraxis.com/2012/08/24/weapons-parrying-draft/
* https://saveversusallwands.blogspot.com/2018/10/alternate-weapons-rules-for-seven.html
    * different dice for damage
    * half damage for edged/pointed against AC 5 and less


Another idea:

* use basic initiative dice
    * no modifiers
* for melee where WC is relevant:
    * first round, for weapons 2 or more classes longer, longer weapon goes first
    * subsequent rounds, longer weapon continues to go first until shorter weapons score a hit
        * at this point, side with shorter weapons have moved within range
    * for weapons within 1 class = use initiative dice for all rounds
    * for natural weapons, give them equivalent WC
        * if this is not possible/doesn't make sense, use initiative dice
* don't need to use weapon vs AC
* weapons all do 1d6
* still use phases
* still use 1.5x attacks against non-fantastic when using 2H weapon
* should use weapon space required (greyhawk?)
* use accumalative HD as written, re-roll all dice but must increase by at least 1
    * not sure it's worth it, better to have the smoothed and slightly improved version for (slightly) more heroic PCs
* use the fixed version for monster attacks
* could even do, for multiple Fighter attacks, a hit is a kill, a miss is still 1d6 damage — that's some real carnage
    * combine with +2 to hit on charge, you're going to go for the charge
    * roll monster HP only when you actually need to

## Monsters

* B/X monsters should be compatible with OD&D (d6 for HD of course).
    * no multiple attack routines, unless a creature has more than one head etc.
    * huge monsters do more damage
    * Give the B/X monster the same damage dice as a giant with the same hit dice

> I run a OD&D campaign, but use the AD&D bestiary. The only thing I change is their AC (since some have very low AC, including some in the negative). The way I do is this: If the monster have 0 or 1 AC, they have 2 AC but can only be hit with silver weapon. If they have -1, only +1 weapon. If they have -2 or less, +2 weapon.

> B/X and B/X-compatible sourcebooks are pretty much usable as-is. They just have extra information that most OD&D GMs don't want or need. There are three areas where you may need to make a change.
>
> Monster HD: Technically use d8s instead of d6s, but the stat blocks frequently don't say this.
>
> Attacks and Damage: LBB monsters don't get more than one attack unless they have more than one head, or something like that. Damage is normally 1d6 except for huge monsters. Give the B/X monster the same damage dice as a giant with the same hit dice, or do like I do and set monster damage to 1 hp per hit die, minimum 4, and divide the total by 4, keeping the remainder, to get damage dice + adds.
>
> Movement: 120 feet in B/X is 6" in OD&D, because OD&D has two moves per turn.
>
> Also, you may want to turn all "Evil" creatures in "Chaotic" creatures, even if the B/X or Labyrinth Lord resource lists them as Lawful Evil. But this depends on whether you plan on using alignment, and if you prefer the L/N/C single-axis alignment of OD&D.
