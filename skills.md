## Skill checks

Actions have a (pre-determined, random) difficulty, and you compare against the relevant ability. If the ability is of that value or higher, succeed.

Eg. bend bars.

To determine randomly, roll and sum X d6, where X increases as the difficulty does.

Thief skills can be done in the same way (even though there are no thieves). For some actions, could also add level.

The problem with this approach is that it takes away the roll at the table â€” the randomising has already been done.
