* what to do with 2H weapons?
    * no benefit
    * +1 to damage
    * roll 2D6 and take highest
    * +1 to hit for 2H weapons (better armour penetration)
    * Fighters do D6+1, MUs D6-1
    * only benefit is reach
    * daggers/small at -1 to hit, normal at no benefit, 2H at +1 to hit
* fixed AC — modify to-hit for magical weapons etc.
* use weapon class somehow?
* start max HP
* use intiative roll
    * Dex modifier

TODO:

* all weapons do d6 damage
* engaged within 1"
* surprise
    * which gives one free round (plus initiative in next round?)
    * 10-30 feet (1-3")
        * it's getting initiative in the next round because it's the attacker, see https://odd74.proboards.com/post/260448/thread and https://odd74.proboards.com/post/260448
* use initiative roll
    * Dex?
* use weapon class (as per Chainmail, and assign WC to natural weapons)
* only in melee do you determine who strikes first (by initiative roll)
* no spell casting or missile in melee
* declare actions
* TODO morale
* man-to-man for flank/rear attacks
    * read = +2 to hit, defender can't strike back, lose initiative on next round
    * attacked on defender's left flank = lose initiative on first round
    * attacked on defender's right flank = shield can't be used (?)

On the first round of melee when blows are struck, or in an open space, longer weapons are more likely to strike first — add the weapon's "initiative modifier" to the initiative roll.

On subsequent rounds of melee, shorter weapons are more likely to strike first — subtract the weapon's "initiative modifier" from the initiative roll.

Monsters can be given an initiative modifier if their method of attack is particularly "short" or "long".

TODO simpler?

* no dex modifier for initiative
* side initiative with roll
* 2H weapons need room to use
    * 10' — 5' either side
* 2H weapons get +1 to-hit (always last in massed melee and tight spaces ie. dungeons?)

### Order

1. Surprise
2. Declare actions
3. Initiative
4. Side with initiative takes actions
5. Side that doesn't have initiative takes actions
6. Morale

Repeat 2 to 6.

#### Surprise
#### Declare actions
#### Initiative

Initiative is determined by the DM, or if necessary, by each side (or each group of combatants) rolling a 1d6. The side with the higher roll gains intiative.

Examples where an initiative roll isn't needed:

* Missile fire and spells always go before enemy closes distance for melee
* Longer weapons strike before shorter ones when joining melee
* Shorter weapons strike before longer ones in melee or tight spaces

Examples where an initiative roll is needed:

* Who strikes first in melee
* Missile fire versus spell casting


## Magic weapons and armour

This is interesting: https://odd74.proboards.com/thread/15654/magic-swords-armour

In non-fantastic combat, magical armour reduces number of attacks, and magical weapons increases it.
