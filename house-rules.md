See http://cyclopeatron.blogspot.com/2010/03/gary-gygaxs-whitebox-od-house-rules.html).

* Start at level 3.
* Fighters with Strength 15+ get +1 to-hit.
* Magic-Users with Intelligence 15+ get 1 bonus 1st level spell.
* Clerics with Wisdom 15+ get 1 bonus 1st level spell (which they can use at 1st level).
* PCs can't fight at 0 HP but don't die until minus (level+1) HP.

# My house rules and interpretations

* Firing into melee is allowed, but who it strikes is determined randomly before making the attack roll.
* Two handed weapons do +1 damage.
    These are: two-handed sword, battle axe (which can also be used one handed), pole arm, halberd.  
    The advantage of carrying a one-handed weapon and no shield is that you can also carry a torch.  
* In a 10 foot space, 3 can fight abreast when wielding spears, otherwise 2 for normal weapons.
* Battle axes, morning stars, flails, halberds and two-handed swords need considerable space either to be wielded effectively — one person per 10 feet instead of the usual two.
* Pole arms and pikes are too large for dungeons.  
* You can sacrifice your shield to completely block any single blow that has hit you.
* Spears, daggers and hand axes may be thrown.
* You can identify magic items with the Detect Magic spell.
* A human sized combatant can be attacked by at most 6 attackers. A large create can be attacked by at most 8.
* Note that 6" is the long range for the javelin, based on the Nixie description in Book II (however there is no javelin or short/throwing spear). 3" for "Heavy Foot throwing axes or spears" is from Chainmail.

## Surprise

Roll a 1d6 for surprise. If a side is surprised, they cannot act for the number of rounds on the die (1 or 2).

This also handles monsters that surprise on a range of results or than 1 and 2 — the number rolled (for example 3) is still the number of rounds the surprised party can't act.

## The dungeon

Interesting details in https://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=88&t=70761.

TODO

* If a lantern is dropped, there is a 1/3 chance that the oil will spill and burn out of control for 1 turn.
* Holy water will prevent a PC from turning into an undead or lycanthrope if applied within 2 rounds after death (undead) or 2 turns if taken below 50% HP by lycanthrope.
* Belladonna (deadly nightshade) does 4-24 damage on the 3rd round after consuming an entire bunch.
* If rations are dropped, they might delay pursuit (they can also be "spiked" with belladonna). Rations have the following percentage chance to distract monsters: Intelligent 10%, Semi-intelligent 50%, Unintelligent 90%.
* Treasure: characters may take left-over gold pieces with them, or purchase cheap gems, etc. to also delay monster pursuit. The effects of treasure for such a purpose are as follows: Intelligent 90%, Semi-intelligent 50%, Unintelligent 10%.
* Spikes: takes five (5) melee rounds for one character to set one (1) spike. Check once every Game Turn to see if it slips - 1/3 chance it will. This is for wedging the spike between floor and door or between stones. The doors and door frames in the dungeon are of wood, and a spike driven into them has only a 1/6 chance of pulling loose.
* A rest turn must be taken every hour. The DM will inform the party one (1) Turn in advance that the next Turn will be a mandatory rest, thus giving the party a choice of which turn would be more advantageous for them to rest. ... There is no penalty for fighting when fatigued.
* Hearing distance is up to 80', but sighting distance is 30' (torch/lantern range) or 60' (elf/dwarf or spell infravision range).
* Monster has a 1/3 chance of breaking through a spiked door, or a door being held shut by characters. If the monster does crash through, anyone holding the door will be knocked off their feet and will take 1 round to recover.
* Melee starts when opponents come to within 10' of each other. All blows are considered simultaneous, except as detailed under Surprise.
* No "initiative die" system will be used in the tournament.

Oil.

Oil ignites.

Flasks of oil, set them alight (with a rag in them) and throw.

A flask will create a pool filling one square (about 10' in diameter) and burn for 1 turn.

A thrown flask will shatter 5 out of 6 times (Philotomy has 1 in 10).

From Philotomy:

* Anyone within 5 ft. of the impact point must save vs. Death Ray or be splashed. An ignited splash does 1-3 points of damage.
* A direct hit with ignited oil does 1d6 damage for 2 rounds. (This
assumes the victim and/or his friends are actively trying to wipe
off the oil and douse the flames.)
* A missed throw will miss by 1-10 feet. The direction of the miss
will be determined by rolling 1d8.

Considerations in the use of flaming oil:

* Storage (bulk and weight) of multiple flasks
* Relative fragility of flasks in dungeoneering situations (e.g. falls,
et cetera)
* Time required to retrieve stored flasks
* Time required to preprare a flask (unstopper, insert a rag, et
cetera)
* Source of ignition
* Smell/smoke/wandering monsters
* Enemies who learn and adapt to the PCs tactics
